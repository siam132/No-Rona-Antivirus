# No-Rona Antivirus

## Inspiration
We wanted to develop an app that could help people during these tough times. With the help of public resources and API's, we were able to put together No-Rona Antivirus to help people find resources and get the help that they need.

## What it does
No-Rona Antivirus helps users find resources for the coronavirus. It features a collection of useful resources and links, a map to find testing locations, and a public donations forum to allow users to donate and receive donated goods during these tough times. 

## How we built it
We used React, Bootstrap, and Material UI for the frontend, and Firebase to host the web app.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using React Router, and managing the routes for the app proved to be difficult. It was also our first time using the Google Maps Geocoding API, but we eventually figured out how to use them to reach our end goal.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of developing an app that can help the community get the help they need during these tough times.

## What we learned
We learned about how to use React Router and how to use React Bootstrap, as well as the Google Maps API and the Google Maps Geocoding API.

## What's next for No-Rona Antivirus
In the future, we hope to update No-Rona Antivirus with more resources to help people get the help that they need.
